This file outlines the database model designed for the Guvi Zen class application. It provides a clear understanding of the entities, attributes, and 
relationships involved in the model.

Entities:

User: Represents a person who participates in the Zen class.
Class: Represents a specific Zen class session.
Session: Represents a daily meditation session within a class.
Attendance: Records the attendance of a user in a specific session.
Feedback: Captures feedback provided by a user about a class or session.

Relationships:

One-to-many: A user can attend many sessions.
One-to-many: A class can have many sessions.
Many-to-many: A user can attend many classes, and a class can have many users.
Many-to-one: A feedback is associated with one user and one class.
Data Types and Constraints:

Data types for attributes are chosen based on the nature of the data they represent (e.g., INT for numerical values, VARCHAR for text).
Appropriate constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY) are applied to ensure data integrity.

Additional Considerations:

Indexing: Consider creating indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.
Normalization: Ensure that the database is normalized to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies.
Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive user data.

This database model provides a solid foundation for the Guvi Zen class application. It can be adapted and extended as needed to accommodate future requirements.
